		We present a combination method for generating interpolants for a class of
		first-order theories. Using interpolant-generation procedures for individual
		theories as black-boxes, our method generates interpolants for the combined
		theory. Our method extends that of McMillan to a class of first-order theories,
		which we characterize as <I>equality-interpolating</I> Nelson-Oppen theories.
		We show that this class includes many useful theories such as the
		quantifier-free theories of uninterpreted functions, linear inequalities over
		reals, and Lisp structures. Our method provides a way to integrate interpolant
		generation within existing Nelson-Oppen-style decision procedures (such as
		Simplify, Verifun, ICS, and CVC-Lite).
		<p>
			We have implemented this method in Zap, a symbolic reasoning engine in
			development at Microsoft Research.
