	We define a new decidable logic for expressing
	and checking invariants of programs that manipulate dynamically-allocated
	objects via pointers and destructive pointer updates. The main feature of this
	logic is the ability to limit the neighborhood of a node that is reachable via
	a regular expression from a designated node. The logic is closed under boolean
	operations (entailment, negation) and has a finite model property. The key
	technical result is the proof of decidability. We show how to express
	precondition, postconditions, and loop invariants for some interesting
	programs. It is also possible to express properties such as disjointness of
	data-structures, and low-level heap mutations. Moreover, our logic can express
	properties of arbitrary data-structures and of an arbitrary number of pointer
	fields. The latter provides a way to naturally specify postconditions that
	relate the fields on entry to a procedure to the fields on exit. Therefore, it
	is possible to use the logic to automatically prove partial correctness of
	programs performing low-level heap mutations.
