<p>In <i>Proc. International Symposium on
Software Testing and Analysis,
    2006 </i> (<b><a href="http://www.cis.udel.edu/issta06/">ISSTA 2006</a></b>) </p></center>

We present a method for static program analysis that leverages tests
and concrete program executions.  State abstractions generalize the
set of program states obtained from concrete executions.  A theorem
prover then checks that the generalized set of concrete states covers
all potential executions and satisfies additional safety properties.
Our method finds the same potential errors as the most-precise
abstract interpreter for a given abstraction and is potentially more
efficient.
Additionally, it provides a new way to tune the performance
of the analysis by alternating between concrete execution and theorem
proving.
We have implemented  our technique in a prototype for checking properties
of C# programs.
