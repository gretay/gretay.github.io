This paper shows how to harness
decision procedures to automatically verify safety properties of imperative
programs that perform dynamic storage allocation and destructive updating of
structure fields. Decidable logics that can express reachability properties are
used to state properties of linked data structures, while guaranteeing that the
verification method always terminates. The main technical contribution is a
method of structure simulation in which a set of <I>original</I> structures that
we wish to model, e.g., doubly linked lists, nested linked lists, binary trees,
etc., are mapped to a set of <I>tractable</I> structures that can be reasoned
about using decidable logics. Decidable logics that can express reachability are
rather limited in the data structures that they can directly model. For
instance, our examples use the logic MSO-E, which can only model function
graphs; however, the simulation technique provides an indirect way to model
additional data structures.
