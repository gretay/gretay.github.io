We present a novel framework for automatic inference of efficient
synchronization in concurrent programs, a task known to be difficult
and error-prone when done manually.<br>
Our framework is based on abstract interpretation and can infer
synchronization for infinite state programs. Given a program, a
specification, and an abstraction, we infer synchronization that
avoids all (abstract) interleavings that may violate the specification,
but permits as many valid interleavings as possible.<br>
Combined with abstraction refinement, our framework can be
viewed as a new approach for verification where both the program
and the abstraction can be modified on-the-fly during the verification
process. The ability to modify the program, and not only
the abstraction, allows us to remove program interleavings not only
when they are known to be invalid, but also when they cannot be
verified using the given abstraction.<br>
We implemented a prototype of our approach using numerical
abstractions and applied it to verify several interesting programs.
