<b>Verifying Optimistic Algorithms Should be Easy</b>

We present a formal proof of safety and linearizability of a highly-concurrent optimistic set algorithm.
The key step in our proof is the Hindsight lemma which allows a thread to infer the existence of a global state
in which its operation can be linearized based on limited local atomic observations about the shared state.
The Hindsight lemma <i>eliminates the need for explicitly reasoning about linearization points
by allowing a temporal non-constructive approach to verify linearizability</i>.
Furthermore, it is independent of the particular algorithm considered,
and thus can be reused to verify other algorithms.
</p><p>
The Hindsight lemma assumes that the algorithm maintains certain simple invariants
which are resilient to interference, and thus can be verified using purely thread-local proofs.
As a consequence, the Hindsight lemma allows us to unlock a perhaps-surprising intuition:
a high degree of interference makes non-trivial highly-concurrent algorithms
in some cases much easier to verify than less concurrent ones.
